## v2.11.0 (2021-04-16)

**Note:** NetBox v2.11 is the last major release that will support Python 3.6. Beginning with NetBox v2.12, Python 3.7 or later will be required.

### Breaking Changes

* All objects now use numeric IDs in their UI view URLs instead of slugs. You may need to update external references to NetBox objects. (Note that this does _not_ affect the REST API.)
* The UI now uses numeric IDs when filtering object lists. You may need to update external links to filtered object lists. (Note that the slug- and name-based filters will continue to work, however the filter selection fields within the UI will not be automatically populated.)
* The RackGroup model has been renamed to Location (see [#4971](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/4971)). Its REST API endpoint has changed from `/api/dcim/rack-groups/` to `/api/dcim/locations/`.
* The foreign key field `group` on dcim.Rack has been renamed to `location`.
* The foreign key field `site` on ipam.VLANGroup has been replaced with the `scope` generic foreign key (see [#5284](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/5284)).
* Custom script ObjectVars no longer support the `queryset` parameter: Use `model` instead (see [#5995](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/5995)).

### New Features

#### Journaling Support ([#151](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/151))

NetBox now supports journaling for all primary objects. The journal is a collection of human-generated notes and comments about an object maintained for historical context. It supplements NetBox's change log to provide additional information about why changes have been made or to convey events which occur outside NetBox. Unlike the change log, in which records typically expire after some time, journal entries persist for the life of the associated object.

#### Parent Interface Assignments ([#1519](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1519))

Virtual device and VM interfaces can now be assigned to a "parent" interface by setting the `parent` field on the interface object. This is helpful for associating subinterfaces with their physical counterpart. For example, you might assign virtual interfaces Gi0/0.100 and Gi0/0.200 as children of the physical interface Gi0/0.

#### Pre- and Post-Change Snapshots in Webhooks ([#3451](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/3451))

In conjunction with the newly improved change logging functionality ([#5913](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/5913)), outgoing webhooks now include both pre- and post-change representations of the modified object. These are available in the rendering context as a dictionary named `snapshots` with keys `prechange` and `postchange`. For example, here are the abridged snapshots resulting from renaming a site and changing its status:

```json
"snapshots": {
    "prechange": {
        "name": "Site 1",
        "slug": "site-1",
        "status": "active",
        ...
    },
    "postchange": {
        "name": "Site 2",
        "slug": "site-2",
        "status": "planned",
        ...
    }
}
```

Note: The pre-change snapshot for a newly created will always be null, as will the post-change snapshot for a deleted object.

#### Mark as Connected Without a Cable ([#3648](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/3648))

Cable termination objects (circuit terminations, power feeds, and most device components) can now be marked as "connected" without actually attaching a cable. This helps simplify the process of modeling an infrastructure boundary where we don't necessarily know or care what is connected to an attachment point, but still need to reflect the termination as being occupied.

In addition to the new `mark_connected` boolean field, the REST API representation of these objects now also includes a read-only boolean field named `_occupied`. This conveniently returns true if either a cable is attached or `mark_connected` is true.

#### Allow Assigning Devices to Locations ([#4971](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/4971))

Devices can now be assigned to locations (formerly known as rack groups) within a site without needing to be assigned to a particular rack. This is handy for assigning devices to rooms or floors within a building where racks are not used. The `location` foreign key field has been added to the Device model to support this.

#### Dynamic Object Exports ([#4999](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/4999))

When exporting a list of objects in NetBox, users now have the option of selecting the "current view". This will render CSV output matching the current configuration of the table being viewed. For example, if you modify the sites list to display only the site name, tenant, and status, the rendered CSV will include only these columns, and they will appear in the order chosen.

The legacy static export behavior has been retained to ensure backward compatibility for dependent integrations. However, users are strongly encouraged to adapt custom export templates where needed as this functionality will be removed in v2.12.

#### Variable Scope Support for VLAN Groups ([#5284](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/5284))

In previous releases, VLAN groups could be assigned only to a site. To afford more flexibility in conveying the true scope of an L2 domain, a VLAN group can now be assigned to a region, site group (new in v2.11), site, location, or rack. VLANs assigned to a group will be available only to devices and virtual machines which exist within its scope.

For example, a VLAN within a group assigned to a location will be available only to devices assigned to that location (or one of its child locations), or to a rack within that location.

#### New Site Group Model ([#5892](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/5892))

This release introduces the new SiteGroup model, which can be used to organize sites similar to the existing Region model. Whereas regions are intended for geographically arranging sites into countries, states, and so on, the new site group model can be used to organize sites by functional role or other arbitrary classification. Using regions and site groups in conjunction provides two dimensions along which sites can be organized, offering greater flexibility to the user.

#### Improved Change Logging ([#5913](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/5913))

The ObjectChange model (which is used to record the creation, modification, and deletion of NetBox objects) now explicitly records the pre-change and post-change state of each object, rather than only the post-change state. This was done to present a more clear depiction of each change being made, and to prevent the erroneous association of a previous unlogged change with its successor.

#### Provider Network Modeling ([#5986](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/5986))

A new provider network model has been introduced to represent the boundary of a network that exists outside the scope of NetBox. Each instance of this model must be assigned to a provider, and circuits can now terminate to either provider networks or to sites. The use of this model will likely be extended by future releases to support overlay and virtual circuit modeling.
