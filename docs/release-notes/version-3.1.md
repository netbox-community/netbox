## v3.1-beta1 (FUTURE)

!!! warning "PostgreSQL 10 Required"
    NetBox v3.1 requires PostgreSQL 10 or later.

### Breaking Changes

* The `tenant` and `tenant_id` filters for the Cable model now filter on the tenant assigned directly to each cable, rather than on the parent object of either termination.
* The `cable_peer` and `cable_peer_type` attributes of cable termination models have been renamed to `link_peer` and `link_peer_type`, respectively, to accommodate wireless links between interfaces.

### New Features

#### Contacts ([#1344](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/1344))

A set of new models for tracking contact information has been introduced within the tenancy app. Users may now create individual contact objects to be associated with various models within NetBox. Each contact has a name, title, email address, etc. Contacts can be arranged in hierarchical groups for ease of management.

When assigning a contact to an object, the user must select a predefined role (e.g. "billing" or "technical") and may optionally indicate a priority relative to other contacts associated with the object. There is no limit on how many contacts can be assigned to an object, nor on how many objects to which a contact can be assigned.

#### Wireless Networks ([#3979](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/3979))

This release introduces two new models to represent wireless networks:

* Wireless LAN - A multi-access wireless segment to which any number of wireless interfaces may be attached
* Wireless Link - A point-to-point connection between exactly two wireless interfaces

Both types of connection include SSID and authentication attributes. Additionally, the interface model has been extended to include several attributes pertinent to wireless operation:

* Wireless role - Access point or station
* Channel - A predefined channel within a standardized band
* Channel frequency & width - Customizable channel attributes (e.g. for licensed bands)

#### Dynamic Configuration Updates ([#5883](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/5883))

Some parameters of NetBox's configuration are now accessible via the admin UI. These parameters can be modified by an administrator and take effect immediately upon application: There is no need to restart NetBox. Additionally, each iteration of the dynamic configuration is preserved in the database, and can be restored by an administrator at any time.

Dynamic configuration parameters may also still be defined within `configuration.py`, and the settings defined here take precedence over those defined via the user interface.

For a complete list of supported parameters, please see the [dynamic configuration documentation](../configuration/dynamic-settings.md). 

#### First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) Groups ([#6235](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/6235))

A new FHRP group model has been introduced to aid in modeling the configurations of protocols such as HSRP, VRRP, and GLBP. Each FHRP group may be assigned one or more virtual IP addresses, as well as an authentication type and key. Member device and VM interfaces may be associated with one or more FHRP groups, with each assignment receiving a numeric priority designation.

#### Conditional Webhooks ([#6238](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/6238))

Webhooks now include a `conditions` field, which may be used to specify conditions under which a webhook triggers. For example, you may wish to generate outgoing requests for a device webhook only when its status is "active" or "staged". This can be done by declaring conditional logic in JSON:

```json
{
  "attr": "status",
  "op": "in",
  "value": ["active", "staged"]
}
```

Multiple conditions may be nested using AND/OR logic as well. For more information, please see the [conditional logic documentation](../reference/conditions.md). 

#### Interface Bridging ([#6346](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/6346))

A `bridge` field has been added to the interface model for devices and virtual machines. This can be set to reference another interface on the same parent device/VM to indicate a direct layer two bridging adjacency. Additionally, "bridge" has been added as an interface type. (However, interfaces of any type may be designated as bridged.)

Multiple interfaces can be bridged to a single virtual interface to effect a bridge group. Alternatively, two physical interfaces can be bridged to one another, to effect an internal cross-connect.

#### Single Sign-On (SSO) Authentication ([#7649](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/7649))

Support for single sign-on (SSO) authentication has been added via the [python-social-auth](https://github.com/python-social-auth) library. NetBox administrators can configure one of the [supported authentication backends](https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#auth-providers) to enable SSO authentication for users.
