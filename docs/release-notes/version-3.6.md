## v3.6-beta1 (2023-08-02)

### Breaking Changes

* PostgreSQL 11 is no longer supported (dropped in Django 4.2). NetBox v3.6 requires PostgreSQL 12 or later.
* The `device_role` field on the Device model has been renamed to `role`. The `device_role` field has been temporarily retained on the REST API serializer for devices for backward compatibility, but is read-only.
* The `choices` array field has been removed from the CustomField model. Any defined choices are automatically migrated to CustomFieldChoiceSets, accessible via the new `choice_set` field on the CustomField model.
* The `napalm_driver` and `napalm_args` fields (which were deprecated in v3.5) have been removed from the Platform model.
* The `device` and `device_id` filter for interfaces will no longer include interfaces from virtual chassis peers. Two new filters, `virtual_chassis_member` and `virtual_chassis_member_id`, have been introduced to match all interfaces belonging to the specified device's virtual chassis (if any).
* Reports and scripts are now returned within a `results` list when fetched via the REST API, consistent with other models.
* Superusers can no longer retrieve API token keys via the web UI if [`ALLOW_TOKEN_RETRIEVAL`](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/configuration/security/#allow_token_retrieval) is disabled. (The admin view has been removed per [#13044](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/13044).)

### New Features

#### Relocated Admin Views ([#12589](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/12589), [#12590](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/12590), [#12591](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/12591), [#13044](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/13044))

Management views for the following object types, previously available only under the backend admin interface, have been relocated to the primary user interface:

* Users
* Groups
* Object permissions
* API tokens
* Configuration revisions

This migration provides a more consistent user experience and unlocks advanced functionality not feasible using Django's built-in views. The admin UI is scheduled for complete removal in NetBox v4.0.

#### Configurable Default Permissions ([#13038](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/13038))

Administrators now have the option of configuring default permissions for _all_ users globally, regardless of explicit permission or group assignments granted in the database. This is accomplished by defining the `DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS` configuration parameter. By default, all users are granted permission to manage their own bookmarks and API tokens.

#### User Bookmarks ([#8248](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/8248))

Users can now bookmark their favorite objects in NetBox. Bookmarks are accessible under each user's personal bookmarks list, and can also be added as a dashboard widget.

#### Custom Field Choice Sets ([#12988](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/12988))

Selection and multi-select custom fields now employ discrete, reusable choice sets containing the valid options for each field. A choice set may be shared by multiple custom fields. Additionally, each choice within a set can now specify both a raw value and a human-friendly label (see [#13241](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/13241)). Pre-existing custom field choices are migrated to choice sets automatically during the upgrade process.

#### Pre-Defined Location Choices for Custom Fields ([#12194](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/12194))

Users now have the option to employ one of several pre-defined sets of choices when creating a custom field. These include:

* IATA airport codes
* ISO 3166 country codes
* UN/LOCODE location identifiers

When defining a choice set, one of the above can be employed as the base set, with the option to define extra, custom choices as well.

#### Restrict Tag Usage by Object Type ([#11541](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/11541))

Tags may now be restricted to use with designated object types. Tags that have no specific object types assigned may be used with any object that supports tag assignment.
