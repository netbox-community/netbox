## v4.4.0 (2025-09-02)

### New Features

#### Background Jobs for Bulk Operations ([#19589](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/19589), [#19891](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/19891))

Most bulk operations, such as the import, modification, or deletion of objects can now be executed as a background job. This frees the user to continue working in NetBox while the bulk operation is processed. Once completed, the user will be notified of the job's result.

#### Logging Mechanism for Background Jobs ([#19816](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/19816))

A dedicated logging mechanism has been implemented for background jobs. Jobs can now easily record log messages by calling e.g. `self.logger.info("Log message")` under the `run()` method. These messages are displayed along with the job's resulting data. Supported log levels include `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `ERROR`.

#### Changelog Comments ([#19713](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/19713))

When creating, editing, or deleting objects in NetBox, users now have the option of providing a short message explaining the change. This message will be recorded on the resulting changelog records for all affected objects.

#### Config Context Data Validation ([#19377](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/19377))

A new ConfigContextProfile model has been introduced to support JSON schema validation for config context data. If a validation schema has been defined for a profile, all config contexts assigned to it will have their data validated against the schema whenever a change is made. (The assignment of a config context to a profile is optional.)
