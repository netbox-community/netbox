# NetBox v4.2

## v4.2.0 (2025-01-06)

### Breaking Changes

* Support for the Django admin UI has been completely removed. (The Django admin UI was disabled by default in NetBox v4.0.)
* This release drops support for PostgreSQL 12. PostgreSQL 13 or later is required to run this release.
* NetBox has adopted collation-based natural ordering for many models. This may alter the order in which some objects are listed by default.
* Automatic redirects from pre-v4.1 UI views for virtual disks have been removed.
* The `site` and `provider_network` foreign key fields on `circuits.CircuitTermination` have been replaced by the `termination` generic foreign key.
* The `site` foreign key field on `ipam.Prefix` has been replaced by the `scope` generic foreign key.
* The `site` foreign key field on `virtualization.Cluster` has been replaced by the `scope` generic foreign key.
* The `circuit` foreign key field on `circuits.CircuitGroupAssignment` has been replaced by the `member` generic foreign key.
* Obsolete nested REST API serializers have been removed. These were deprecated in NetBox v4.1 under [#17143](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/17143).

### New Features

#### Assign Multiple MAC Addresses per Interface ([#4867](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/4867))

MAC addresses are now managed as independent objects, rather than attributes on device and VM interfaces. NetBox now supports the assignment of multiple MAC addresses per interface, and allows a primary MAC address to be designated for each.

#### Quick Add UI Widget ([#5858](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/5858))

A new UI widget has been introduced to enable conveniently creating new related objects while creating or editing an object. For instance, it is now possible to create and assign a new device role when creating or editing a device from within the device form.

#### VLAN Translation ([#7336](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/7336))

User can now define policies which track the translation of VLAN IDs on IEEE 802.1Q-encapsulated interfaces. Translation policies can be reused across multiple interfaces.

#### Virtual Circuits ([#13086](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/13086))

New models have been introduced to support the documentation of virtual circuits as an extension to the physical circuit modeling already supported. This enables users to accurately reflect point-to-point or multipoint virtual circuits atop infrastructure comprising physical circuits and cables.

#### Q-in-Q Encapsulation ([#13428](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/13428))

NetBox now supports the designation of customer VLANs (CVLANs) and service VLANs (SVLANs) to support IEEE 802.1ad/Q-in-Q encapsulation. Each interface can now have it mode designated "Q-in-Q" and be assigned an SVLAN.
