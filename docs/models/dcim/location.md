# Locations

Racks and devices can be grouped by location within a site. A location may represent a floor, room, cage, or similar organizational unit. Locations can be nested to form a hierarchy. For example, you may have floors within a site, and rooms within a floor.

The name and facility ID of each rack within a location must be unique. (Racks not assigned to the same location may have identical names and/or facility IDs.)
